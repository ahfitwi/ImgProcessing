BLOB stands for Binary Large OBject and refers to a group of connected pixels in a binary image.
A Blob is a group of connected pixels in an image that share some common
property ( E.g grayscale value ). In the image above, the dark connected regions are blobs, 
and the goal of blob detection is to identify and mark these regions.
How it works:
    1. Threshold input images to binary.
    2. Grouping: connected white/black pixels are grouped together. 
    3. Merging: blobs located closer than minDistBetweenBlobs are merged.
    4. Center & Radius Calculation :  The centers and radii of the new merged blobs are computed and returned.
    
Can be filtered by color, size or shape
